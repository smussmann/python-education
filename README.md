# Python Education

I'm writing these modules to help some friends learn Python.

I'm not quite sure how this is all going to end up going, but something like this seems useful enough to share with the world.  Even if only 3 people will probably ever read it. :-)

## p1_weather

You should modify p1_weather to make the `high`, `low`, `daily_high`, and `daily_low` functions do what their docstrings say.

You can run the `p1_weather` file to see what output your code gives on the default data like so:

```
python p1_weather.py
```

There are some tests, too, which currently don't do more than check that you get the right answer when running on the default data.  You can run them like this:

```
python p1_weather_test
```
